“Acknowledged alarm via CLI: lab1b-db-connection-failures entered ALARM at <timestamp> with reason <StateReason>.”


“Confirmed failures in /lab1b/app logs showing DB connection errors (timestamps align with alarm transition).”


“Validated DB host/port/dbname are sourced from SSM Parameter Store and present.”


“Validated DB credentials are stored in Secrets Manager (secret exists, expected keys present). Suspected drift if connectivity is OK but auth fails.”


“Recovered by restarting the RDS, which cleared DB connection failures and returned alarm to OK.”


“No redeploy performed. Followed observation-first: alarm → logs → config sources (SSM/Secrets) → targeted fix.”
